This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Environment Configuration

Before running the project, you'll need to set up the environment variables by creating an `.env` file at the root of your project. You can use the `.env.example` file as a template to define the required variables. Here's an example of how the `.env` file should be configured:

```plaintext
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=
```

Make sure to fill in the values according to your environment settings. These environment variables are essential for the proper functioning of the project and should be kept secret.

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Run Tests

```bash
npm run test

```
